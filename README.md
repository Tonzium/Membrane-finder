# Membrane-finder

Membrane-Finder is a dedicated tool designed to track and reorganize data related to the usage and storage status of various membrane batches.
With a complex system of triggers and tracking mechanisms, this tool ensures that users can instantly determine which membrane batch is currently in use and which is stored away.

By backtracking various triggers, such as membrane maintenance times and membrane change times, the tool provides a comprehensive history.
This offers insights into the lifespan of each membrane, detailing when it was in the machine and when it was moved to storage.

By recording maintenance and change times, the tool offers a detailed timeline for each membrane. This allows for better planning and understanding of membrane wear and tear.
